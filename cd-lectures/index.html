        Elaine Lopez’s lecture focuses on decolonisation. Her work revolves around shaping her identity through learning more about her culture and traditions. This can be seen in the work of “Bolita” in which she interviews her grandmother about how luck is played through animal imagery. I never realized how much of our design comes from the cultures that are more dominant in our world, the characteristics of white supremacy. Through the exhibition "souvenirs from the futures," we can see the different realities of other cultures. Listening to her lecture made me realise that I should reconnect with my roots, and add more warmth to my work.

        Watching her lecture got me mesmerised. My favorite part of the introduction was asking students what our names mean. As our names have stories. Her projects such as "Seat at the table" also included giving voice to the voiceless. A visually striking name to show who is represented. I enjoyed her thorough ideation for this concept using a distinct colour scheme and clear sketches. Especially the concept design for the loudspeaker, one that amplifies not only verbally but also visually. This completely changes the experience for the user. I equally enjoyed her exhibition that honours the deities from Cambodia which allowed people to virtually and fully immerse themselves into the art, culture and religion. Helping other people to be culturally aware with other people in a safe space.
