    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">: A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Lialina discusses web elements in the 90s that were popular such as outer space backgrounds, arrows and buttons that were 3D and were rendered. She also highlights problems other users faced such as internet users from Russia that resulted in them making multiple encoded buttons. What sparked my interest were the multiple colours used as well as the detailed GIF designs of the “mail me” button. These animated GIFs aren't common in today's culture. The aesthetic of the 90's encourages us to compare and to recognize the differences in visual elements.
        Laurel Schwulst: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?
        Schwulst rethinks the meaning of websites using metaphors as natural objects such as a puddle, garden, or as a room. These are different capacities of how we arrange and organise our information. Through the use of these visual elements, websites can help shape our thoughts and help us create our personalities more effectively. The quote “ I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web” made me reflect on the web today and to see how else we can improve it.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">: Typography and the Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
       During the years of 1984 to 1997, Staples expressed her observations and explored the digital transition of typography. We see how using typefaces digitally makes it easier to manipulate the visual aesthetics and forms of design. Users have the ability to interact with the webpage using the selection tool. This tool allows them to drag the screen to help add focus and precision to the visual elements on the webpage. The term “aliasing” caught my attention since I was unfamiliar with it. It made me think of how this effect makes the font seem to be “zoomed in” compared to smooth fonts, which further made me look at fonts and their identity - how they elicit certain characteristics and personas. Evolving with brand identity. The development of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is also fascinating to see as it continues to develop their purpose as well as helping designers in visualizing their typography. Being able to see images and fonts "in a single pictorial layer" was thought-provoking since I had never appreciated such a basic feature I use in my daily life. These explorations are incredibly useful as we can dissect what we know and how these typographic elements have been developed to create fonts and letters in these advanced softwares.
       My questions are
       How are fonts with "Aliasing" perceived differently from the 20th century to the 21st century?
       How can we further explore typography with the knowledge we have gained from Photoshop and Illustrator?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Web’s Grain </span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero 
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Using nature imagery and comparisons, this reading helped us understand a different perspective about responsive design. As a result, I now perceive percentages and pixels differently, similar to grain, evoking different emotions. Other elements such as typography and photography are incorporated and combined to enhance this experience. Instead of using grids and aligning each element, it made me question typical design methods. Instead of using physical methods of creating a collage, overlapping these pieces together. Comparing the elements to Scrabble and Polaroids. A theme that caught my attention was "edgelessness". By eradicating borders, the transitions between slides are more seamless. By doing so, a new path for alliance between these elements is created. Overall, this reading was highly reflective of what web design and responsive design is.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Black Gooey Universe </span> by <span class="author"> American Artist 
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The reading essentially explains the purpose of a GUI that makes software easier to read, across screens, and for people of all levels of knowledge to use. It was first used on a commercial computer named "Lisa". The ideology of racial slavery was one that I did not think would be included due to the extent of technology which puzzled me. I realised how far objects have been white to create the façade of being "pure" or "pristine". The reading proceeds on to discuss the use of colours, which is a crucial factor in the analysis of graphical user interfaces as black is everywhere. Termed "primordial" and "conterpuntal". Since the screen is off when the devices are off, the colour that appears is black and reflective. Including the colour white and others that reflect light. As a whole, this reading provided a deeper understanding of user interface design.  
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
     Questions: How far has GUI changed in terms of interactions and how can we make it more accessible?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Function as Narrative </span> by <span class="author"> Weiyi Li
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>Form and function are interconnected in a dynamic relationship. Products need both variables to be optimal. In order to achieve efficiency, function is absolutely necessary in our daily lives. In addition, the writer describes how objects have been divided and extensively researched when constructing them. This is part of their process, which, in my opinion, is not arbitrary since one can understand how the product was made and the materials utilized. The designer should carefully consider the purpose of the object, the environment in which it will be used, and the needs and preferences of the users. The use of using different objects as stamps shows us the exploration of typical vs non-typical as we can find other uses for what objects are typically known for. In conclusion, form and function are two crucial aspects of design and engineering. In order to create products that are both effective and aesthetically pleasing, these factors must be taken into consideration during the design process.
    </p>

    <p>
     Questions: Are the ideas of form and function the same virtually compared physically?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Can the internet be archived? </span> by <span class="author"> Jill Lepore
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>The title of the reading asks us a question. "Can the internet be archived?" We see how many websites are overwritten, web pages are cited but data will always be stored online. However this is debated saying that websites "tend to die with their hosts." This reading then follows the history of the Internet Archive with anecdotes by the writer. We see the difference between large amounts of data that have been stored digitally and physically. The Wayback Machine, a collection of old websites, illustrates its effectiveness. It is used extensively and further tools are used to discover pages using keywords. Six hundred thousand people use the Wayback Machine every day." Reading this made me contemplate the different ways data is stored, including CDs, audiobooks, radio, and films. When interacting with these webpages, the user is also influenced by the ease of access.  
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
     How can "the Wayback Machine" be further improved or altered for people with disabilities?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Data Feminism / Collect, Analyse, Imagine, Teach </span> by <span class="author"> Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>The reading discusses how data and power is distributed and how marginalized communities do not receive it. "The matrix of dominance" We learn that we need to take the root causes into account when it comes to creating data sets as biases occur. It also follows the concepts of justice, responsibility, equity, and co-liberation. Learning and unlearning the information we know, and designing systems to address the root of bias which is structural inequality. It is also imperative to find ways to benefit both systems in a mutually beneficial manner. In doing so, trust is maintained and accuracy is ensured. Knowing these values and morals is what differentiates us from being a data and statistics expert. </p>

    <p>
     In what ways can we teach people across demographics to collect data ethically?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index </span> by <span class="author"> Marie Hoejlund and Mindy Seu
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>We are introduced to cyberfeminism, a genre of feminism that critiques the relationship between women and technology. It reimagines the internet and new media technologies.

        An overview of Mindy Seu's ambitious and comprehensive project, the Cyberfeminism Index, is provided. One thought process I admired was the extension of data collected and varied through multiple occupations to achieve multiple perspectives. The Arial font was also chosen because it was designed by women, another artistic choice.
        
        The interview in the reading also highlights MS' perspective on collective data. This involves gathering data such as logos and symbols of websites with personality in them. Keeping websites alive. 
        
        The environment and the web were also discussed. The concept of using solar-powered servers reduces energy consumption. While websites are known for gathering and accumulating data, the reading further questions how they can be designed so that users do not become part of the process. In addition, to not be dependent on popular platforms.</p>
<br>
    <p>
        Is there any way we can incorporate diversity of these users and allow this data to be shared more widely and more easily across the globe?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> The Adventures of an Avatar and the real girl </span> by <span class="author"> Helen Gregory
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>The reading expands on the concept of "Indegenious Futurism". Incorporating Indigenous perspectives can be envisioned in the present and, more significantly, in the future. It further iterates the perspective of space and time. Both concepts are different from each other and Indigenous culture is known to be primitive however focuses on how they are today and have evolved. We see the eradication of our interpretation of that culture which is often deemed "negative"

        This is depicted by using time travel and avatars intertwined with natural backgrounds such as Mother Earth and natural resources. The combination of both contrasting elements creates a dystopian and multidimensional effect. The avatars are fully emotional and have physical reactions just like humans. I appreciate Goddess Aphrodite's Greek mythology inspiration. This is an idea that sheds light on Indigenous culture that has been rethought. </p>

What can we do to enhance technology to help others appreciate nature and native cultures?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Glitching the Master’s House </span> by <span class="author"> Legacy Russel 
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
 <p>This is an interview with Momtaza Mehri and Legacy Russell about Legacy's manifesto "Glitching feminimism". It talks about how Black, queer or femme-identified artists are misrepresented in the media. Their voices and creative journeys are not appreciated and recognised. They have historically not been included in books, so this book creates a space for them. Another segemnt in the interview also comments on how these voices instead refer to cisgendered white indentified and white presenting people. Other marginalized communities have done the same thing which should be given more priority to. In the media, however, Tik Tok and other platforms talk about this which is appreciated and is the start for this advocation. Overall, there is a "demand for legibility" and correcting the stigma and depreciation for Black, queer and trans communities which needs to progress immensely. </p>
 <p>How can we give more spaces to Black queer and trans people to present their creative works?</p>
