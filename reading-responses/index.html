    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">: A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina </span></h2>

    <p>
        Lialina discusses web elements in the 90s that were popular such as outer space backgrounds, arrows and buttons that were 3D and were rendered. She also highlights problems other users faced such as internet users from Russia that resulted in them making multiple encoded buttons. What sparked my interest were the multiple colours used as well as the detailed GIF designs of the “mail me” button. These animated GIFs aren't common in today's culture. The aesthetic of the 90's encourages us to compare and to recognize the differences in visual elements.
        Laurel Schwulst: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?
        Schwulst rethinks the meaning of websites using metaphors as natural objects such as a puddle, garden, or as a room. These are different capacities of how we arrange and organise our information. Through the use of these visual elements, websites can help shape our thoughts and help us create our personalities more effectively. The quote “ I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web” made me reflect on the web today and to see how else we can improve it.
