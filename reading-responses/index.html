    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">: A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Lialina discusses web elements in the 90s that were popular such as outer space backgrounds, arrows and buttons that were 3D and were rendered. She also highlights problems other users faced such as internet users from Russia that resulted in them making multiple encoded buttons. What sparked my interest were the multiple colours used as well as the detailed GIF designs of the “mail me” button. These animated GIFs aren't common in today's culture. The aesthetic of the 90's encourages us to compare and to recognize the differences in visual elements.
        Laurel Schwulst: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?
        Schwulst rethinks the meaning of websites using metaphors as natural objects such as a puddle, garden, or as a room. These are different capacities of how we arrange and organise our information. Through the use of these visual elements, websites can help shape our thoughts and help us create our personalities more effectively. The quote “ I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web” made me reflect on the web today and to see how else we can improve it.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">: Typography and the Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
       During the years of 1984 to 1997, Staples expressed her observations and explored the digital transition of typography. We see how using typefaces digitally makes it easier to manipulate the visual aesthetics and forms of design. Users have the ability to interact with the webpage using the selection tool. This tool allows them to drag the screen to help add focus and precision to the visual elements on the webpage. The term “aliasing” caught my attention since I was unfamiliar with it. It made me think of how this effect makes the font seem to be “zoomed in” compared to smooth fonts, which further made me look at fonts and their identity - how they elicit certain characteristics and personas. Evolving with brand identity. The development of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is also fascinating to see as it continues to develop their purpose as well as helping designers in visualizing their typography. Being able to see images and fonts "in a single pictorial layer" was thought-provoking since I had never appreciated such a basic feature I use in my daily life. These explorations are incredibly useful as we can dissect what we know and how these typographic elements have been developed to create fonts and letters in these advanced softwares.
       My questions are
       How are fonts with "Aliasing" perceived differently from the 20th century to the 21st century?
       How can we further explore typography with the knowledge we have gained from Photoshop and Illustrator?

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Web’s Grain </span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero 
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Using nature imagery and comparisons, this reading helped us understand a different perspective about responsive design. As a result, I now perceive percentages and pixels differently, similar to grain, evoking different emotions. Other elements such as typography and photography are incorporated and combined to enhance this experience. Instead of using grids and aligning each element, it made me question typical design methods. Instead of using physical methods of creating a collage, overlapping these pieces together. Comparing the elements to Scrabble and Polaroids. A theme that caught my attention was "edgelessness". By eradicating borders, the transitions between slides are more seamless. By doing so, a new path for alliance between these elements is created. Overall, this reading was highly reflective of what web design and responsive design is.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Black Gooey Universe </span> by <span class="author"> American Artist 
    </span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The reading essentially explains the purpose of a GUI that makes software easier to read, across screens, and for people of all levels of knowledge to use. It was first used on a commercial computer named "Lisa". The ideology of racial slavery was one that I did not think would be included due to the extent of technology which puzzled me. I realised how far objects have been white to create the façade of being "pure" or "pristine". The reading proceeds on to discuss the use of colours, which is a crucial factor in the analysis of graphical user interfaces as black is everywhere. Termed "primordial" and "conterpuntal". Since the screen is off when the devices are off, the colour that appears is black and reflective. Including the colour white and others that reflect light. As a whole, this reading provided a deeper understanding of user interface design.

     Questions: How far has GUI changed in terms of interactions and how can we make it more accessible?
