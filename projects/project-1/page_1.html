<h1> <em> in praise of shadows</em></h1>

<h2>an excerpt by <ul>jun'ichiro tanizaki </ul> </h2>


<div class="one"> i possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but i understand that in the gothic cathedral of the west, the <ul> roof</ul> is thrust 
  <p>up and up</p> </div> 


<div class="two">so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. in the <p>temples of japan,</p> on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. 
  nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what <p>first strikes the eye</p> is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. the grand temples of kyoto-chion'in, honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves. </div>
<div>in making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. there are of course roofs on western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. if the roof of a japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. there are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep japanese eaves. the fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. a light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. the quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in <b>dark rooms</b>, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</div>
<div>and so it has come to be that the beauty of a japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. westerners are amazed at the simplicity of japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. the light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. we do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. the storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. a luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. we delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. we never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. and so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. the hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. and from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own. -->

<div class="three">       
  <div>of course the japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging

    o

    l
    <br>
    l and a flower arrangement. but the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. we value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room. -->
      </div>

      <div class="four">   <div>we have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of kyoto or nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. so dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. the lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.</div>
