  <p>What is morse code?</p>
  <br>

  <p>This is an alphabet where letters are represented by combinations of long and short light or sound signals.</p> <p>A visual representation can also be made using dots and dashes.</p>


<p>Morse code was named after Samuel Morse and other inventors who helped establish this language in the early 19th century. This website presents the international Morse code. American and international morse code exist independently where the later is more accurate and easier to learn with short dashes. 

  The International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters A through Z, one accented Latin letter (É), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Morse code symbols are formed by a sequence of dits and dahs.
  
  The length of a dot is one unit. 
  
  The space between letters is 3 units
  
  The space between words is 7 units 
  
  The Morse system was first based on the English alphabet, but did not work for other languages. In 1848, Fredrich Clemens Gerke refined the Morse Code into the Hamburg Alphabet, and it’s this alphabet that we now know as the International Morse Code.
  
  Did you know that Morse Code has a rhythm, and can be thought of as music? Every Dot or dit • , and every dash, or dah -, has a musical pattern and beat.
  
  In Germany, Morse Code has been set to the rhythm of Beethoven’s “Fifth Symphony.” There is even a British detective television series “Inspector Morse” set to Morse Code! In fact, the lead character, Chief Inspector Morse’s last name is the theme spelled out to music in DADAH DADADAH DIDAHDIT DIDIDIT DIT!
